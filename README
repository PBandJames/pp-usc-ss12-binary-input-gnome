Running Caribou
===============

cd src
python ./caribou.py --debug

When an editable text widget has focus, a keyboard should pop up. There are
still some problems with the text focus detection and keyboard placement.

Use the right control key (Control_R) to quit caribou. 




Running Caribou with Binary Input Enabled
===============

cd src
python ./caribou.py -b

Caribou will start as normal and run as normal, except it will now accept
binary input.

Detailed instructions on the binary input method can be found here:
